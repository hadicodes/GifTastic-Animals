# GifTastic-Animals
A repo that uses the giphy API to display animal gifs that are searched and requested.

This webapp allows you to search for giphy GIFS of animals that you like and display them to the webpage using Jquery dynamically created buttons. You can click on the preloaded animal buttons on the webpage to retrieve GIFS related to those animals. You can also create your own preferred animal buttons to retrieve GIFS related to your that particular animal. Click once on a GIF to play and once again to stop their animations. Have fun and enjoy!

JavaScript and jQuery were used to change the HTML of of the website site dynamically.
